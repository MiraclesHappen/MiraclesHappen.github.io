### Background Introduction:

Good evening, every one! So nice to see you here! Since it is still in the course of the Spring Festival, according to our tradition, I'd like to say "Happy Spring Festival" to everyone here.

In this long holiday, I am so glad to see that my parents, in their sixties, are still in good health condition, and that my brother and sister have steadily developed their small business, and that my cousin with whom I spent my happy childhood have eventually found her true love.

I believe most of you, like me, have got enjoyable moments by sharing quality family time, spoiling yourselves in travel, joining friend parties,running into someone for whom you have longed for decades, or simply getting lucky money via Wechat etc... 

But some of you may locked yourselves in the room, a real heaven of your own only,pondering on your oncoming career path, initiating a new business or setting up a brand-new study plan.

Or else, there may be some who encountered embarrassing or unhappy blind dates, or who suffered bumpy roads and crowds during their Spring Festival trips. 
Whatever,I reckon you have too much to share with us in the Miracle Happen English salon, to share your happiness with us, or to disclose your sorrow and unhappiness as well.

### Questions:

1. Is there anything refreshingly change your hometown? 
2. Regarding Spring Festival ceremony activities, do you like current ones or those of decades ago? 
3. It is widely acknowledged that traffic congestion has become a common phenomenonon highways during Spring Festival rush days; what do you suggest to relieve this problem?
4. Being bombarded by hundreds of festival calls and messages, do you feel tired of answering them, what do you do to cope with them?
5. Compared with decades ago, nowadays, children can receive more lucky money. Do you think it should be encouraged? 
6. Share good news or something made you happy happened to your family.
7. Did you encounter any difficulty during your trips, what happened, how did you manage to overcome them? 
8. For those who were busily engaged in blind dating, no matter actively participating in or being driven into it, tell us how you feel about your counterparts, was there anyone who touched your heart, share us your stories. 
9. Mandarin or your local accents, which one do you prefer? What do you think of your local accents? Have they ever brought you some pleasant or unpleasant experiences?
