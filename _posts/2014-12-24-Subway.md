## Speech

1. The price of subway ticket is going to raise finally. How will it influence your life? Will you try to avoid taking subway if possible? Someone argues the raised price will lead less crowd on subway, what's your opinion?
	+ ￥4 for 6-12km
	+ ￥5 for 12-22km
	+ ￥6 for 22-32km
	+ Above 32km, ￥1 for every 20 km
	
2. Do you think the "Subway Security Check" is necessary? On one hand, we really worry about someone like terrorist take explosive on to the subway. On the other hand, currently the inspector of subway is not doing a good job, and due to our huge population it is unable to check everyone's bag.

3. How do you spend your time on subway? Read? Listen? Refresh your WeChat? Do you think we should use the time on subway to learn something instead of relax or entertainment?

4. There are 2 categories of beggars on subway. One sells their wretchedness, one sells their songs. Which category do you think is more wothy for donating? Considering limited social resources, the weak and the working hard, who should be helped firstly?

5. Offerring the seats to the old and children is always being encouraged be us. But young people have to work overtime often. People taking a nap can be seen everywhere on the subway. Do you think they are the ones who should take the seats rather than the old and children?

6. What are you gonna to do if your cell phone or bag drops into the railway by accident? And what about if it is yourself drops?

7. Someone suggests the seats should be removed for room to contain more people on subway. And I know some country like Japan has done like that. Like the image below, the seats are locked to the wall during rush period. What's your opinion?
