### Background Introduction:

Everybody must have a dream city / place to settle down, build a career, and live a happy life.

For me, my dream place is some peaceful country in the UK, since I have long expected a well-received cultural tradition around me.

And if possible, I prefer to live with an extended family and share my feelings with my dear family members regularly, rather than pursue my dreams alone in a noisy, crowded city.

Nowadays, in my mind, maybe a little bit radical, China's Confucianism-centered tradition has been smashed. It seems that our Chinese have lost the spiritual home and live a wandering life with no clear direction. Sometimes, I accept this kind of state and feel excited when I find my friends and soul mates. But sometimes, I feel boring and tired; and become homesick and throw myself into memories of happy times in my childhood.

From my point of view, it seems that I cannot realize my dreams in any Chinese city. Indeed, I have never visited the UK, even never gone abroad. I have just watched some British TV shows. And I guess that maybe, I can live a dream life in a fancy country in the UK.
